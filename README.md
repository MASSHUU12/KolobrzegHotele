## Overview of our website

### Homepage

![homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61974579/146548889-77acaa25-aee1-432b-9817-eabde4f58f78.png)

#### The clarity of the home page makes it easy to use, and the availability of English and German versions makes it easy to access for tourists from abroad. Thanks to categories such as: distance from the beach, proximity to city bike stations or type of accommodation each person will receive the results best suited to their preferences.

### Search results

![Search results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61974579/146549746-6a6da0ed-818e-4767-8709-dccd9cf8b8bf.png)

#### Search results are displayed based on how important each category is to a person. For example, if it is very important for a person to have accommodation as close to the sea as possible, the accommodation that is displayed will be those closest to the sea, often at the expense of other categories, so for example playgrounds may be further away.

### Offer view

![offer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61974579/146550027-31d2b403-e90b-4778-b4c4-5791065fe250.png)

#### The offer view contains all information about a given offer that is contained in OpenData of the city of Kolobrzeg. In addition, the offer view is enriched by a map showing the location of accommodation, and the nearest points such as city bike stations, recreation areas, playgrounds or dog runs. Also at the bottom of the page you can find the nearest interesting monuments.
